#Sass in Depth book project

In our lives, whenever we encounter a great experience whether it be a great movie, a vacation location or a technology toolset, our desire is to share it with everyone we encounter. That is how we feel about Sass and that's why we decided to write a book. There have been plenty of introductory books on Sass, however we felt that our field was missing a more advanced book—a book that goes beyond the basics of Sass and lays the proper groundwork for a project using Sass.

[Sass in Depth](http://www.manning.com/dsande/) is targeted to those who have learned the basics of Sass, have a working knowledge of CSS and are looking to expand their knowledge of Sass to implement it in their current development environment.

##What's in this project?
Along with writing the book, we felt that to really express the power of Sass, there needs to be a real life example project. A project that clearly illustrates how-to examples as we discuss the features themselves. By the end of the book and project, we are confident that you will go from CSS hacker to Sass master!

##How to use this project
Well ... not there yet. Hold tight, more details to come soon. Thinking something along the lines of release tags. But I'll let you know as I work it out.
